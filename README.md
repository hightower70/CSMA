# CSMA
Port of JAMA to C#

This repository if a fork of Tim Felty's port of the NIST JAMA library to C#.
I have removed the jagged array storage and changed to unifrom storage. I've also added some overloaded operators, functions (ToString, Equals, GetHashCode) which are common in c# classes.

The original JAMA code included the following:
